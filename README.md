# Hi!

- I am actually a noob when it comes to actual scripting in JavaScript in KubeJS and ZenScript in CraftTweaker despite writing a lot of recipes by hand. 
  - There *might* even be more efficient ways of writing them all. 
- I am not a software engineer!
  - I just happened to pick up programming languages very well because of my understanding of the documentation for [KubeJS](https://kubejs.com/) and [Just-the-Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/). Outside of that I don't have the practical knowledge for JavaScript, Ruby, SCSS, HTML etc. to be able to create things on my own.
- Where is your artwork?
  - Currently not available online, though my butterfly profile picture and Project Vyre logo are some of them.
  - There are now two exceptions for this: the new ModernFix logo and new unofficial KubeJS logo made so it looks good on Devin's badges. I'll provide the badges below so you can see how they look.

Also currently working on the Finality modpack series (see below) and [Another Create Wiki](https://github.com/Project-Vyre/another-create-wiki) which is intended for Create players and beginners looking to *create* large factories and train networks.

- [Finality Omnia](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/finality-omnia) - Development postponed.
- [Finality Tau](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/finality-tau) - Development postponed.
- [Finality Genesis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/finality-genesis) - Development priority.
- [Finality Mote](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/finality-genesis) - Development secondary.

Looking for the Finality modpack and wiki repositories? They are now located here in the [Project Vyre](https://github.com/Project-Vyre) GitHub Organization.

<summary>The actual reason why activity might stop altogether.</summary>
 
I don't really want to talk about my current situation as it might be laughable by some, but I am a bit of a [failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZEaX8a_YU) as an adult despite being what was considered the "gifted and talented" student [through](https://youtu.be/90Fpjwctqlw) elementary, middle school and high school. I even taught how to use Blender 2.8 during my last year in high school in my Digital Arts class.
 
You could say I am bit dysfunctional and running on [fumes](https://youtu.be/6eh39VWPIj4), in other words.
 
All of my work will be transferred to a new owner or become public domain once I am [deceased](https://youtu.be/O7uy4ws5-RU) if I am unable to write a will. There's a lot of things out of my control at the moment.
