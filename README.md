# Hi!

Looking for my profile's repository? [Click here.](https://github.com/CelestialAbyss/CelestialAbyss)

A few clarifications:

- I am actually a noob when it comes to actual scripting in JavaScript in KubeJS and ZenScript in CraftTweaker despite writing a lot of recipes by hand. 
  - There *might* even be more efficient ways of writing them all.
- Looking for custom Create related recipes? Go here: https://github.com/CelestialAbyss/Create-Customized
- I am not a software engineer!
  - I just happened to pick up programming languages very well because of my understanding of the documentation for [KubeJS](https://kubejs.com/) and [Just-the-Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/). Outside of that I don't have the practical knowledge for JavaScript, Ruby, SCSS, HTML etc. to be able to create things on my own.

### Where is your artwork?

Currently not available online, though my butterfly profile picture and Project Vyre logo are some of them.

- There are now two exceptions for this. I'll provide the badges below so you can see for yourself.
  - The new ModernFix logo.
  - The unofficial KubeJS logo made so it looks good on Devin's badges.
  - I did contribute to the new Embeddium logo, but did not come up with the original design.
  - TauMC logo.

![Powered by KubeJS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CelestialAbyss/badges/main/kubejs/powered_by_kubejs/cozy_64h.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Yes, I was offered compensation for both the ModernFix and TauMC logos but I declined out of my own volition.

## Projects

- [Another Create Wiki](https://github.com/Project-Vyre/another-create-wiki), currently a work in progress and not finished at all.
- [Create Customized](https://github.com/CelestialAbyss/Create-Customized), a repository filled with KubeJS and CraftTweaker examples. Work in progress!
- [Absinthe](https://github.com/CelestialAbyss/absinthe), a fork of [Universalator](https://github.com/nanonestor/universalator) by [nanonestor](https://github.com/nanonestor). I probably shouldn't be diving into this without more experience, but I did want to at least try... üòì
- Currently working on the Finality modpack series, (see below) which intended for Create players and beginners looking to *create* large factories and train networks.

### Keyboard History

Sorted by chronological order of acquisition.

| Name | Status | Switch | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| Keychron V6 | Functional | Keychron Red | Mine includes the analog knob and uses the Frosted Black plastic case. |
| Corsair K55 (old gen) | Defunct | Rubber Dome |Unfortunately suffered some liquid damage while I was cleaning it. Temporarily had to switch to the HP keyboard that came with my OMEN Obelisk. |

### Mouse History

Sorted by chronological order of acquisition.

| Name | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Logitech G502 X Lightspeed | Functional | My current mouse, but I'm still worried due to a vocal minority saying that the optical switches started double clicking after a few months.
| OMEN Reactor | Functional | This was probably the first mouse in the market to use optical switches on the main mouse buttons. Scroll wheel no longer scrolls properly nor does it middle click properly. The shortcomings of mechanical rotary encoders. Currently in storage. |
| Logitech M705 Marathon (old gen) | Functional | Uncomfortable to use and the tracking accuracy is abyssmal. In reality I used the Microsoft Designer Mouse more than this. |
| Microsoft Designer Mouse | Functional | In storage. |
| Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse | Functional | Gave away to a friend of mine. |

| Motorola Moto G4 Plus | Functional | In storage. |
| Microsoft Lumia 640 | Functional | In storage. |

<summary>Music I listen to...</summary>

Since Google will delete accounts after **two years** of inactivity, I will be keeping my playlists archived in [this repository](https://github.com/CelestialAbyss/CelestialAbyss) in the form of markdown files.

A music video to explain why sudden inactivity may occur and I may or may not be gone entirely.

<summary>The actual reason why activity might stop altogether.</summary>
 
I don't really want to talk about my current situation as it might be laughable by some, but I am a bit of a [failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZEaX8a_YU) as an adult despite being what was considered the "gifted and talented" student [through](https://youtu.be/90Fpjwctqlw) elementary, middle school and high school. I even taught how to use Blender 2.8 during my last year in high school in my Digital Arts class.
 
You could say I am bit dysfunctional and running on [fumes](https://youtu.be/6eh39VWPIj4), in other words.
 
All of my work will be transferred to a new owner or become public domain once I am [deceased](https://youtu.be/O7uy4ws5-RU) if I am unable to write a will. There's a lot of things out of my control at the moment.
