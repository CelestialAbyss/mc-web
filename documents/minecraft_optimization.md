A general list of NeoForge / Forge optimization mods that I use. The majority of Fabric users should already be familiar with theirs

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note that this is currently a work in progress!

> [!WARNING]
> This optimization mod list was only tested on computers with x86 CPUs with NVIDIA / AMD GPUs. I can't confirm that computers with ARM CPUs will have the same performance.

<summary>Archived stuff here.</summary>

- Redirector
- LazyDFU (don't use in 1.20+)
- FerriteCore (required with ModernFix)
- NotEnoughRecipeBook (this was discovered because of a funny incident in voice chat and watching server TPS die due to the vanilla recipe book and player data, thank <@930222347166818404>  for mentioning this)
- ImmediatelyFast (though it *can* definitely cause issues so use at your own risk)
- Starlight (don't use in 1.20+ but can still break lighting)
- Better chunk loading by someaddon (Predictive chunk loading based on player movement and more)
